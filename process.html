        <h2 class="sub-heading he"><u>Process Management</u>:</h2><br>
        <div class="matter">
            <p><b>Process</b> is the execution of a program that performs the actions
                specified in that program.. It can be defined as an execution unit where a program runs. A Program does nothing unless its instructions are executed by a CPU. A program in execution is called a process. 
                In order to accomplish its task, process needs the computer resources.<br>
                <b>Process management</b> involves various tasks like creation, scheduling, termination of processes, and a dead lock. 
                Process is a program that is under execution, which is an important part of modern-day operating systems. 
                The OS must allocate resources that enable processes to share and exchange information. 
                It also protects the resources of each process from other methods and allows synchronization among processes.
            </p>
            <p>
                There may exist more than one process in the system which may require the same resource at the same time. 
                Therefore, the operating system has to manage all the processes and the resources in a convenient and efficient 
                way. It handles operations by performing tasks like process scheduling and such as resource allocation.
            </p>
            <p>Process memory is divided into <b>four</b> sections:
                <ol>
                    <li>The <b>program memory</b> stores the compiled program code, read in from non-volatile storage when the program is launched.</li>
                    <li>The <b>data section</b> stores global and static variables, allocated and initialized before executing the main program.</li>
                    <li>The <b>heap section</b> is used to manage dynamic memory allocation inside our program. 
                        In other words, it is the portion of memory where dynamically allocated memory resides i.e., memory allocation via 
                        new or malloc and memory deallocation via, delete or free, etc.</li>
                    <li>The <b>stack section</b> stores local variables defined inside our program or function. Stack space is created for local
                        variables when they are declared, and the space is freed up when they go out of scope. </li>
                </ol>

                    <li><b>Running</b>: Instructions are being executed.</li>
                    <li><b>Waiting</b>: The process is waiting for some event to occur (such as an I/O
                        completion or reception of a signal).</li>
                    <li><b>Ready</b> The process is waiting to be assigned to a processor</li>

                <p>
                    Process Control Block is a data structure that contains information of the process related to it. The process control block is also known as a task control block, entry of the process table, etc.
                    It is very important for process management as the data structuring for processes is done in terms of the PCB.It also defines the current state of the operating system.

                    <li><b>Process state</b>: A process can be new, ready, running, waiting, etc.</li>
                    <li><b>Program counter</b>: The program counter lets you know the address of the next instruction, which should be executed for that process.</li>
                    <li><b>CPU registers</b>: This component includes accumulators, index and general-purpose registers, and information of condition code.</li>
                    <li><b>CPU scheduling information</b>: This component includes a process priority, pointers for scheduling queues, and various other scheduling parameters.</li>
                    <li><b>Accounting and business information</b>: It includes the amount of CPU and time utilities like real time used, job or process numbers, etc.</li>
                    <li><b>Memory-management information</b>: This information includes the value of the base and limit registers, the page, or segment tables. This depends on the memory system, which is used by the operating system.</li>
