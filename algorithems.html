            <h4>There are six popular process scheduling algorithms</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) Scheduling</li>
                <li>Shortest-Job-Next (SJN) Scheduling</li>
                <li>Priority Scheduling</li>
                <li>Shortest Remaining Time</li>
                <li>Round Robin(RR) Scheduling</li>
                <li>Multiple-Level Queues Scheduling</li>
            </ul>
            These algorithms are either non-preemptive or preemptive. 
            Non-preemptive algorithms are designed so that once a process enters the running state, it cannot be preempted until it completes its allotted time, whereas the preemptive scheduling 
            is based on priority where a scheduler may preempt a low priority running process anytime when a high priority process enters into a ready state.

                <p>
                    It is the simplest algorithm to implement. Processes are executed on first come, first serve basis i.e., the process with the minimal arrival time will get the CPU first.
                    The lesser the arrival time, the sooner will the process gets the CPU. It is the non-preemptive type of scheduling.
                    Its implementation is based on FIFO queue. The main drawback about this algorithem is that it is poor in performance as average wait time is high.

                The job with the shortest burst time will get the CPU first. 
                The lesser the burst time, the sooner will the process get the CPU. It is the non-preemptive type of scheduling.
                It is  easy to implement in Batch systems where required CPU time is known in advance. But impossible to implement in interactive systems where required CPU time is not known, which is a major drawback
                The processer should know in advance how much time process will take.

        <p>
            In Priority scheduling, there is a priority number assigned to each process. 
            In some systems, the lower the number, the higher the priority. While, in the others, the higher the number, the higher will be the priority. The Process with the higher priority among the available processes is given the CPU. 
            <br>There are <b><i>two types</i></b> of priority scheduling algorithm exists. 
            One is <b><i>Preemptive priority scheduling</i></b> while the other is <b><i>Non Preemptive Priority scheduling</i></b>.
            <br>
            The priority number assigned to each of the process may or may not vary.
            If the priority number doesn't change itself throughout the process, it is called <b><i>static priority</i></b>, while if it keeps changing itself at the regular intervals, it is called <b><i>dynamic priority</i></b>.

                    The Process P1 arrives at time 0 with the burst time of 3 units and the priority number 2. 
                    Since No other process has arrived till now hence the OS will schedule it immediately.
                    <br>
                    Meanwhile the execution of P1, two more Processes P2 and P3 are arrived. Since the priority of P3 is 3 hence the CPU will execute P3 over P2.<br>
                    Meanwhile the execution of P3, All the processes get available in the ready queue. The Process with the lowest priority number will be given the priority. Since P6 has priority number assigned as 4 hence it will be executed just after P3.<br>
                    After P6, P4 has the least priority number among the available processes; it will get executed for the whole burst time.

                        From the GANTT Chart prepared, we can determine the completion time of every process. 
                        The turnaround time, waiting time and response time will be determined.<br>
